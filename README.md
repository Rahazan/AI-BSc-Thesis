##Proposal abstract
In affective computing systems are developed and studies that work with human affects. For instance, emotion recognition. Many of these applications and researches are done in a lab setting, where it is the question to what extent the findings translate to the real world. It also creates a barrier for training programs which train participants through biofeedback.

I wish to investigate the feasibility of using portable devices measuring galvanic skin response to determine cognitive load.
